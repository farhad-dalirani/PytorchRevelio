# PytorchRevelio Introduction

PytorchRevelio is a collection of classes and functions that allow you to investigate MLP and convolutional networks written in Pytorch. These classes and functions enable you to visualize features that neurons and filters have learned or illustrate a saliency map for a given image. Even a Deep-Dream function is provided to have more fun. You can calculate feature visualization and saliency map with several different methods. Although Some of these methods are better than others, we included weaker methods for educational purposes.

## Where can we use it?
With PytorchRevelio you can investigate MLP and Convolutional neural networks that are written in Pytorch. There is no matter that you have writtern the network or it is a Pytorch build-in neural network such as VGG-19.
